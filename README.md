# Tap For Sound

I have developed this Android application back in 2014. I had no Git experience yet, so unfortunately no commit history is available. However, you can look at the code I wrote as an undergraduate.

It was the time I saw many soundboard apps rise and decided to create my own soundboard application with the custom sounds which I found hilarious at the time.
